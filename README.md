# October Learning Challenges

## To Dos
	[ ] Github Actions
		use github actions to:
			[x] add linting and other tests to github so that we can prove that things work before they get moved into the codebase deploy the code to w/e we choose (probably containers)
			
			[ ] What do I need to understand:
				[ ] You need to understand exactly what it's for.
				[ ] What we can do with it.
				[x] How to implement using Github runners
				[ ] How to implement using our own runners
				
	[ ] Pre-commit
		[ ] use ruff to make checks and reformat code before it is commited.
		[ ] the precommit should be supported by both the agents and yourself.
		
	implement mcp:
