# October Learning Challenges
	
	[ ] Github Actions
		use github actions to:
			[ ] add linting and other tests to github so that we can prove that things work before they 
			[ ] get moved into the codebase
			
			[ ] deploy the code to w/e we choose (probably containers)
			
			
			[ ] What do I need to understand:
				[ ] You need to understand exactly what it's for.
				[ ] What we can do with it.
				[ ] How to implement using Github runners
				[ ] How to implement using our own runners
				
	[ ] Pre-commit
		[ ] use ruff to make checks and reformat code before it is commited.
		[ ] the precommit should be supported by both the agents and yourself.
		
	implement mcp:
		[ ] to allow an llm to connect to a postgres db
		[ ] to allow an llm to connect to a SQL Server db
		[ ] to interact with an api
		
	deploy an agent:
		to understand how you do that
			[ ] watch youtube agent video
			[ ] participate in Kaggle / Google Agent stuff
		
		to undertake actions on my behalf
			[ ] lookup prices
		
	implement a multiple agent architecture
